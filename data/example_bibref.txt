=1. Importance of Theological Study.=--In the short period of time
that measures the span of mortal existence, it is not possible for man
to explore any considerable portion of the vast realm of knowledge; it
becomes, therefore, the part of wisdom to select for study the
branches that promise to prove of the greatest worth. All truth is of
value--above price indeed in its place; yet with respect to their
possible application, some truths are of incomparably greater worth
than are others. A knowledge of the principles of trade is essential
to the success of the merchant; an acquaintance with the laws of
navigation is demanded of the mariner; familiarity with the relation
of soil and crops is indispensable to the farmer; an understanding of
the profound principles of mathematics is necessary to the engineer
and the astronomer; so too is a practical knowledge of God essential
to the salvation of every human soul that has attained to powers of
judgment and discretion. The value of theological knowledge,
therefore, ought not to be under-rated; it is doubtful if its
importance can in any way be over-estimated.
=2. What is Theology?=--The word "theology" is of Greek origin; it
comes to us from _Theos_, meaning God, and _logos_--a treatise, or
discourse, signifying by derivation, therefore, collated knowledge of
Divinity, or the science that teaches us of God, implying also the
relation existing between the Supreme Being and His creatures. The
term is of very ancient usage, and may be traced to pagan sources.
Plato and Aristotle speak of theology as the doctrine of Deity and
divine things. Concisely defined, theology "is that revealed science
which treats of the being and attributes of God, His relations to us,
the dispensations of His providence, His will with respect to our
actions, and His purposes with respect to our end."
=3.= It has been held by some as a truth, that theological knowledge
is not properly a subject for analytical and otherwise scientific
treatment on the part of man; that inasmuch as a true conception of
Deity, with which theology has primarily to deal, must necessarily be
based upon revelation from the source divine, we can but receive such
knowledge as it is graciously given; and that to attempt critical
investigation thereof by the fallible powers of human judgment would
be to apply as a measure of the doings of God the utterly inadequate
wisdom of man. Many truths are beyond the scope of unaided human
reason, and theological facts have been declared to be above reason;
this is true so far as the same remark might be applied to any other
kind of truth; for all truth, being eternal, is superior to reason in
the sense of being manifest to reason, but not a creation of reason;
nevertheless truths are to be estimated and compared by the exercise
of reason.
=4. The Extent of Theology.=--Who can survey the boundaries of this
science? It deals with Deity--the fountain of knowledge, the source of
wisdom; with the proofs of the existence of a Supreme Being, and of
other supernatural personalities; with the conditions under which, and
the means by which, divine revelation is imparted; with the eternal
principles governing the creation of worlds; with the laws of nature
in all their varied manifestations. Primarily, theology is the science
of God and religion; it seeks to present "the systematic exhibition of
revealed truth, the science of Christian faith and life." But in a
more general sense, theology has to do with other truths than those
which are specifically called spiritual; its domain is co-extensive
with that of truth.
=5.= The industrial pursuits that benefit mankind, the arts that
please and refine, the sciences that enlarge and exalt the mind, are
but fragments of the great though yet uncompleted volume of truth that
has come to earth from a source of eternal and infinite supply. The
comprehensive study of theology, therefore, would embrace all known
truths. God has constituted Himself as the great teacher;[2] by
personal manifestations or through the ministrations of His appointed
servants, He instructs His mortal children. To Adam He introduced the
art of agriculture,[3] and even taught by example that of
tailoring;[4] to Noah and Nephi He gave instructions in ship
building;[5] Lehi and Nephi were taught of Him in the arts of
navigation;[6] and for their guidance on the water, as in their
journeyings on land, He prepared for them the Liahona.[7] a compass
operated by a force more effective than that of terrestrial
magnetism; furthermore, Moses received divine instructions in
architecture.[8]

Humanity--focal point, inheritor and trustee of the world--exists to know
its Creator and to serve His purpose. In its highest expression, the
innate human impulse to respond takes the form of worship, a condition
entailing wholehearted submission to a power that is recognized as
deserving of such homage. "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible,
the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever."(32) Inseparable
from the spirit of reverence itself is its expression in service to the
Divine purpose for humankind. "Say: All bounties are in the hand of God:
He granteth them to whom He pleaseth: and God careth for all, and He
knoweth all things."(33) Illumined by this understanding, the
responsibilities of humanity are clear: "It is not righteousness that ye
turn your faces towards East or West", the Qur'�n states, "but it is
righteousness--to believe in God ... to spend of your substance, out of
love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer,
for those who ask...."(34) "Ye are the salt of the earth",(35) Christ
impresses on those who respond to His call. "Ye are the light of the
world."(36) Summarizing a theme that recurs time and again throughout the
Hebrew scriptures and will subsequently reappear in the Gospel and the
Qur'�n, the prophet Micah asks, "...what doth the Lord require of thee,
but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"(37)
